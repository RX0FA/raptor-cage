Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This Contributor License Agreement (the "Agreement") governs the terms under
which contributions ("Contributions") are made to this project (the "Project").

By submitting a Contribution to the Project, you agree to the following terms:

1. License.

You grant the Project an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
license to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sublicense your Contribution in
any form, including future versions of the Project.

2. Waiver of Ownership and No Withdrawal.

You waive any claim to ownership of your Contribution and acknowledge that
your Contribution is provided without expectation of compensation. Once
submitted, your Contribution cannot be withdrawn and is irrevocably part of
the Project, including any modifications or future versions.

3. No Warranty.

Your Contribution is provided "as-is", without warranty, and the Project has no
obligation to use or incorporate it.

4. Representations and Warranties.

You represent that you have the right to submit the Contribution and that it
does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.

5. Agreement Term and Impact if Project Disappears.

This Agreement remains in effect indefinitely. Even if the Project or its main
repository is discontinued, deleted, or abandoned, your Contribution remains
governed by this Agreement. The rights granted to the Project are perpetual and
continue to apply to all forks, derivatives, or any other uses of
the Contribution in the future, regardless of whether the original Project
exists.
