## üí° Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Run Windows game, runner and prefix paths are relative to Bottles data directory.
raptor-cage run -r soda-9.0-1 -p my_prefix -d ~/games/some_game -b game.exe

# Run native binary, and pass custom parameters.
raptor-cage run -r soda-9.0-1 -p my_prefix -d ~/games/some_game -b native_binary -- --param1
```

## üìå Frequently Asked Questions

* How to enable MangoHud?  
  Use the `-e MANGOHUD=1` parameter for games that use DXVK and VK3D, other games (OpenGL and WineD3D) may require to prepend `mangohud` before the binary (e.g., `mangohud wine game.exe`).
* What is the difference with Bottles?  
  Bottles is a GUI to manage Wine/Proton instances and their dependencies, it runs under Flatpak and it uses the same sandbox permissions as Bottles itself, that means that applications that are launched from Bottles have access to everything Bottles has access to (you can see what can Bottles access [here](https://github.com/flathub/com.usebottles.bottles/blob/master/com.usebottles.bottles.yml#L9)), raptor-cage launches applications with a restricted sandbox by default, and allows the user to adjust permissions independently.
* Do I need Bottles in order to use raptor-cage?  
  No, Bottles is not needed, although is highly recommended in order to manage Wine/Proton versions and dependencies. If you don't want to use Bottles, you can download any Wine/Proton version you like, extract it anywhere and choose the respective path when running raptor-cage (`-r`).
* What is the difference with Bubblewrap?  
  Bubblewrap (bwrap) is used under the hood by raptor-cage, you could use bwrap directly too, however it would require careful configuration of dozens of parameters.
* Do I need Steam in order to use raptor-cage?  
  Not at all, raptor-cage objective is to allow the user to run games in a sandbox without relying on closed-source or corporate launchers/tools.
* You say that Steam is not required, but I still need to install `steam-native-runtime` on ArchLinux  
  The `steam-native-runtime` package on ArchLinux includes a lot of dependencies that Wine/Proton require to run games, it's used as a convenience shortcut to bring the necessary dependencies into your system, you can avoid installing `steam-native-runtime` by using the raptor-cage binary (non-package version) and install the dependencies yourself.
* Why do I have Steam icons on ArchLinux?  
  `steam-native-runtime` will be installed as a dependency of raptor-cage, if you want to avoid such icons, ignore the respective files on `pacman.conf`
  ```conf
  # /etc/pacman.conf
  NoExtract   = usr/bin/steam usr/bin/steam-runtime usr/bin/steamdeps usr/share/applications/steam.desktop
  NoExtract   = usr/bin/steam-native usr/share/applications/steam-native.desktop
  ```
* Do I still need `steam-native-runtime` on Manjaro?  
  Yes, even though Manjaro includes more dependencies than regular ArchLinux (which helps in many cases), if `steam-native-runtime` is not installed, there will still be some games that will just freeze with no explanation, or sometimes Wine/Proton will report that a dependency (like `libvulkan1.so`) is missing despite that not being the case.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

### Maintenance

```bash
# Check for dependency vulnerabilities.
cargo audit

# Check for updates.
cargo upgrade --dry-run
```

### TODOs

#### General

* Some games (like HC2, DXM) create a detached sub-process, since we are using `--die-with-parent`, said games will not run when executed directly (with `-b` parameter, executing a shell and launching manually still works); so we need to think in a way to detect child processes and wait for them, or at least add a flag to enable this feature. Disabling `--die-with-parent` is another option, but that would undermine security a bit and leave lingering wine processes all over the place. Maybe add a `--lead-process=NAME_EXE:TIMEOUT` to wait for another process inside the sandbox.
* Implement bash autocompletion, should be able to autocomplete prefix and runner names based on the ones detected under Bottles.
* If application binary `-b` does not end with `.exe`, do not prepend `wine`, it's possible that the user wants to run a custom command like `mangohud` or a native Linux game.
* Add `integrate` sub-command to create integrations e.g., `.desktop` shortcut, entry on Heroic launcher.
* Native wayland support, see https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wine-9.22-Released and https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wine#Wayland.
* Add `kill` sub-command to terminate all processes in a sandbox, need to connect to existing bwrap container.
* Add argument to mount additional paths (needed for installers and maintenance), syntax can be similar to Docker's `-v PATH:FLAGS`.
* When using the `integrate` sub-command to create a `.desktop` shortcut, extract executable icon and set it respectively. It can be done with a small windows executable calling a win32 API call or natively on Linux by using `wrestool`.
* Add NTSYNC support, see also https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-NTSYNC-Driver-Ready.

#### Packaging

* AUR package, also add `mangohud` as optional dependency.
* Setup GitHub Actions to automatically publish AUR package.
* Normal binary release.
* cURL install script.
* Create deb package. It should depend on Steam libraries (similarly to Arch's `steam-native-runtime`), see https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=steam&searchon=names&suite=noble&section=all.
* Make a reusable lib version (`Cargo.lock` needs to be ignored, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html).

#### Maybe

* Simple GUI delivered as Flatpak that builds the needed commands based on the selected options, and creates `.desktop` shortcuts.
* Investigate a way to use `--new-session` while allowing the user to read the output, without relying on seccomp, probably an easy fix could be to create an HTTP server where the output can be seen.
* Fork `steam-native-runtime` and remove Steam related stuff (i.e., keep dependencies only) and implement GitHub Actions for update checking and deployment to the AUR. This would prevent the `pacman.conf` workaround described in the FAQ.
* Create overlay filesystem on top of game directory in order to allow writing data without affecting the underlying files (could be used instead of `:rw`).
